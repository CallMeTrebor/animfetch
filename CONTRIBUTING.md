# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing. To ensure a smooth process, we recommend following the steps below.

## How to contribute
1. Create an issue for the thing you wish to contribute.
2. The issue should be open to suggestions from other members of the community.
3. Open a branch for your contribution and give it a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-windows-formatting`, `add-colored-snowflakes`).  
   You donâ€™t have to use `fix` for fixes or `add` for new features; make sure the branch name makes sense  
   (e.g., avoid meaningless names like `apple-branch`).
4. Create a pull request.
5. Contributors review the pull request, either approving or rejecting it.
6. Update the issue so everyone involved is notified.

## Conventions

Try to keep the style consistent with the rest of the codebase, but here are some concrete ground rules:

### Python

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- `snake_case` for functions, files, and variables.
- `CamelCase` (starting with a capital letter) for type names (e.g., classes).
- `UPPERCASE` for constants.

### Other languages

If you want to add a new type of file, try to follow the most widely accepted conventions for that language; if need be, we will include a section for the new language
